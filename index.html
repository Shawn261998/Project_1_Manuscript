				<h2> Design Education: Brilliance Without Substance</h2>
				<p>-Don Norman <br> October 4, 2011 in Columns</p>
			</header>
			<section><p> We are now in the 21st century, but design curricula seem stuck in the mid 20th century, except for the addition of computer tools. The 20th century developed craftspeople capable of magnificent products. But these were relatively simple products, with simple mechanical or electrical components. In the 21st century, design has broadened to include interaction and experience, services and strategies. The technologies are more sophisticated, involving advanced materials, computation, communication, sensors, and actuators. The products and services have complex interactions that have to be self-explanatory, sometimes involving other people separated by time or distance. Traditional design activities have to be supplemented with an understanding of technology, business, and human psychology.
				With all these changes, one would expect major changes in design education. Nope. Design education is led by craftspeople who are proud of their skills and they see no reason to change. Design education is mired in the past.
				A quick definition. I focus upon the areas called industrial and product design, broadly defined to include interaction, experience and service design. Actually, I believe the problems I discuss apply pretty widely across the multiple design fields, but I haven’t examined the curricula of these other areas with the same care as I have for the industrial and product design areas.
				Designing a new design curriculum is fraught with difficulties. I’ve written about this (see my core77.com column “Why design education must change.”) (Also available on this website, jnd.org.)
				I have helped organize conferences on design education and have attended others. I’ve literally traveled around the world to discuss design education at major universities in Asia, North America and Europe.
				The critiques I present are commonly voiced. I have to report that I see many positive examples of curriculum change, for example, the curriculum reforms being put in place at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft, in the Netherlands). Other schools are exploring similar changes. The responses to my core77.com article have, on the whole, been positive, and some schools have asked for my opinion and help. Still, I find the vast majority of schools incredibly resistant, unable to change. Yes, a few faculty members may wish to join the 21st century, but the departments as a whole strongly resist.
				Designers are proud of their creative thinking, of how they break out of traditional solutions to problems, examining new potential directions without prejudice. “Do not criticize” is a frequently cited mantra during the ideation phase of a project, because criticisms, even if valid, kill creativity. Let the criticisms come later.
				But try to think creatively about the design curriculum and fierce defensiveness comes into play. My experience is that designers believe the mantra of no criticism during ideation, but they are unable to apply it to themselves, especially when it comes to changes in the curriculum.
				The world has changed, I explain (over and over again). In the past we trained wonderful craft skills of sketching and exploration. The tools were drawing and model building, shop skills and even the computer revolution in drawing and fabrication tools. But today design is more than appearance, design is about interaction, about strategy and about services. Designers change social behavior. So shouldn’t designers understand the fundamental principles of human and social interaction, of how to assess the validity of a claim? The designer’s role is not easy; in addition to their traditional design skills, they must now be expert at human behavior as well as understand how to deploy new technologies emerging from the rapid advances in computers and communication, materials and sensors, actuators and displays.
				“Yes, yes,” say my design friends, “but there is no room in the curriculum.”
				“Every field says this,” I explain, for I have heard the same objection in departments of engineering and social sciences, engineering and science, literature and art. But in other fields, the curriculum is divided into specialties. All students must take some core courses, but then, depending upon their area of specialization, the curriculum changes. Moreover, the university itself requires students to take courses outside their department and even outside their school so that they have some balance of knowledge.
				Much of design training takes place in specialized schools of art, architecture or design, where there appears to be no understanding of the need to broaden the education. In fact, many of these schools do not even offer courses outside of their major area. Moreover, within design, there seldom is specialization: everyone gets a heavy dosage of the core elements. The few electives that are permitted tend to be within design.
				Given that lengthening the duration of study is impractical, the only way to make room in a curriculum is by dropping existing requirements. Why not? Does every designer have to have the same depth of skill in drawing, model building, CAD tools and prototyping?
				Product design is still a fundamental part of modern design, but so too is communication, interaction, experience. So too is service design and design for the environment. Almost all products now have microprocessors, communication links, sophisticated sensors and actuators, and display. Sure, designers are whizzes at packaging these, but where do they pick up the skills to make the interaction smooth, understandable, functional and pleasurable? Do they know how to validate the designs? And what of systems, where the design is only a small component of the entire system, whether it be one for transportation, health, education or the environment? Why should every student have to go through so much training in drawing 2D and 3D? In fabrication? Not all designers need this stuff.
				Where is the content matter in design? Nowhere. It is all technique. All craft. As a result, in many new, important arenas with heavy technological and social components, the design requirements, parameters and constraints—and often even the first draft designs—are being done by non-designers. Interaction design is being done by computer scientists and psychologists. Other areas use engineers and professionals in the fields of operations, city planning, transportation, and health. Designers are called in afterward to make it all look good—the very attitude we have been fighting. Yes, the design community complains, but I place the blame squarely on the limited reach of design education. It is our own fault.

				<h3>My Perspective on the Evolution of Design Education</h3>
			</header>
			<section>  <p>Returning to school after a two-year hiatus, I found myself eagerly anticipating how the curriculum abroad would differ from what I had experienced in my home country.  Fortunately, graduating from an undergrad school that had an affiliation with Parsons, I hardly noticed any changes concerning what the professors were trying to teach. The key distinction, in my opinion, lies in how a professor approaches design teaching. Design is a dynamic field, continually evolving with time, from the first iPhone to the latest iterations that shape global trends. This nonstop evolution of products, graphics, and fashion is what drives me to pursue a Ph.D. in user experience design. I sliced this article mainly because of two reasons.
				If I wanted to take teaching as my future profession, I would need to understand how the evolution of design works, and how to speculate where the trend of design education leads to.
				Don Norman has always been one of the few people I look up to when I think of functional design. His book Design for Everyday Things is what drove me to understand user experience.
				Being able to relate to the topic and the author of this article is what made me choose this read. </p>

	   <p> In essence, Norman tries to argue how flawed the education system related to design is. He tackles the problems which he feels could essentially solve a lot of confusion in the design community. To keep my response connected with the original article I have structured it in a way that seems to be more of a discussion than just a blurb of my thoughts. I would like to make my webpage interactive so that everyone would be able to write their responses to this article as well. </p>

		<blockquote>“There is no evidence for the statement that designers think by drawing. It is similar to the old belief that studying Latin or Greek led to better thinking for which there was also no evidence.”</blockquote>

		<p>Growing up in India, where craftsmanship is deeply ingrained in various art forms, sketching has traditionally held a prominent role in the design industry. However, reading Norman's article made me question the necessity of sketching in today's design world. Do I need to fill countless sketchbooks before applying to a design college? Does sketching truly enhance creativity? In my experience–while drawing and sketching have helped convey ideas effectively, tools like Rhino3D, Illustrator, and Figma have proven equally valuable. In retrospect, I would understand why Norman specifies the curriculum as being ancient. I would agree that having an average skill with a pencil and paper would suffice to explain my idea. </p>
		  
		  <blockquote>“Modern design is the interface between technology and people, yet the curriculum leaves no room for any understanding of either technology or people. Outside of the few design schools that are located within technical universities, I searched in vain for any evidence that the students get any exposure to science, math, or technology. I searched in vain for psychology courses or any of the behavioral or social sciences.“</blockquote>
		  
		  <p>In my final year of undergrad, my juniors used to ask me which class was the best I'd ever attended. Interestingly I would never think about this question before answering,
		  
		  My response would always be the studio class cause those are the most credit ones. But in my heart, I knew that the speculative design class was the best one, being always intrigued with users I found this subject very interesting. In this class we would just talk about technology, have hours of discussions, and understand why need/want could be the next big problem in the world. Learning about people is fundamental to design; it involves understanding the psychology of user needs, even before they recognize those needs themselves.</p>
		  
		  <blockquote>"We must not lose the wonderful, delightful components of design. The artistic side of design is critical: to provide objects, interactions, and services that delight as well as inform, that are joyful. Designers do need to know more about science and engineering, but without becoming scientists or engineers. We must not lose the special talents of designers to make our lives more pleasurable."</blockquote>
		  
		<p>I wanted to take this text by Norman to conclude what I feel is the crux of the article. Design is a complex subject. It is the subject that requires all the components of education from science, mathematics, psychology, and even business to work together. Tomorrow's designers must embrace both the artistic and technical aspects of design education, recognizing that it's not just about craftsmanship and software proficiency but also about understanding the psychology that underlies effective design.</p>
